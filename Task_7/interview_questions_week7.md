## ‚úÖ Key Concepts Summary

### üîÑ **Fetch API**

An in-built browser API to make HTTP requests (like GET, POST) and handle responses asynchronously using promises.

### üßµ **Promises**

A promise is an object that represents the **eventual result** of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, or `rejected`.

### üï∞Ô∏è **Asynchronous JavaScript**

Allows code to run in the background (non-blocking) using **callbacks, promises, or async/await**, enabling better performance and user experience.

### üßæ **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**

A lightweight, text-based data format used to exchange data between client and server. Easily parsed using `JSON.parse()` or created using `JSON.stringify()`.

### üåê **API (Application Programming Interface)**

A set of rules that allows one software to interact with another. REST APIs use HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to manipulate resources.

### üö® **Error Handling**

Errors in Fetch API are handled using `.catch()` or `try...catch` blocks when using `async/await`. Useful for catching network or parsing errors.

## üß† Interview Questions & Answers

---

### 1. ‚ùì **What is Fetch API?**

**Answer:**
The Fetch API provides a modern interface to make HTTP requests in the browser. It returns a **Promise** that resolves to the response of the request.

```js
fetch("url")
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

---

### 2. ‚ùì **How do promises work?**

**Answer:**
Promises represent the result of an asynchronous operation. They have three states:

- `pending` (initial),
- `fulfilled` (resolved),
- `rejected` (error).

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("Success!");
});
```

---

### 3. ‚ùì **Difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**

**Answer:**

- **Synchronous**: Code runs line-by-line, blocking the next step until complete.
- **Asynchronous**: Code doesn‚Äôt wait ‚Äî operations like fetching data run in the background, using callbacks/promises.

---

### 4. ‚ùì **How to handle errors in Fetch?**

**Answer:**

```js
try {
  const response = await fetch("api-url");
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error("Network error");
  const data = await response.json();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Fetch failed:", error.message);
}
```

---

### 5. ‚ùì **What is JSON?**

**Answer:**
JSON stands for **JavaScript Object Notation**. It‚Äôs a lightweight data format used for storing and transferring data between server and client.

---

### 6. ‚ùì **What is CORS?**

**Answer:**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a **security feature** in browsers that blocks requests from different domains unless explicitly allowed by the server.

---

### 7. ‚ùì **How to parse JSON?**

**Answer:**

- To convert a JSON string to an object:

  ```js
  const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
  ```

- To convert an object to a JSON string:

  ```js
  const json = JSON.stringify(obj);
  ```

---

### 8. ‚ùì **Explain async/await.**

**Answer:**
`async`/`await` are modern JavaScript keywords used to handle asynchronous code in a **synchronous-looking way**.
Example:

```js
async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch("url");
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
}
```

---

### 9. ‚ùì **What are HTTP status codes?**

**Answer:**
Status codes indicate the result of an HTTP request:

- `200`: OK
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad Request
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `404`: Not Found
- `500`: Server Error

---

### 10. ‚ùì **What is a REST API?**

**Answer:**
A REST API is a way for clients and servers to communicate over HTTP using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Resources are usually accessed via URLs.

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus Questions

---

### 11. ‚ùì **What is the difference between `fetch()` and `XMLHttpRequest`?**

**Answer:**
`fetch()` is a modern, promise-based API with cleaner syntax. `XMLHttpRequest` is older and more verbose.

---

### 12. ‚ùì **What is the difference between `.then()` and `async/await`?**

**Answer:**
Both handle promises, but:

- `.then()` chains callbacks
- `async/await` makes async code look synchronous

---

### 13. ‚ùì **What happens if you forget `await` in async functions?**

**Answer:**
The promise won‚Äôt be resolved before the next line runs, which can lead to bugs or undefined results.

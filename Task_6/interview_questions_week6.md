# ‚úÖ Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. How to validate form inputs in JavaScript?
Form inputs can be validated using JavaScript by accessing input values via the DOM (`document.getElementById` or `form.elements[]`), then checking conditions like:
- If fields are empty
- If input matches a pattern (e.g., email via regex)
- If the length is within limits

On failure, display error messages and prevent submission using `event.preventDefault()`.

---

## 2. What is `event.preventDefault()`?
`event.preventDefault()` stops the default action associated with an event. For form submission, it prevents the browser from reloading the page or sending data until validation passes.

---

## 3. How to check email format with regex?
You can use a regex like:

```js
const emailRegex = /^[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+$/;
emailRegex.test(emailInput.value);
```
This checks if the email follows the `username@domain.extension` format.

## 4. Difference between client-side and server-side validation?

| Feature      | Client-side           | Server-side             |
|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Performed on | Browser (JavaScript) | Server (Backend language) |
| Speed        | Faster (no request needed) | Slower (involves request) |
| Security     | Less secure          | More secure             |
| Visibility   | Visible to user      | Hidden from user        |
| Usage        | For UX, quick feedback | For enforcing security & logic |

---

## 5. How to show error messages dynamically?
You can select an HTML element (like `<small>` or `<span>`) below the input and set its `textContent` to the error message using JavaScript. Example:

```js
const error = input.nextElementSibling;
error.textContent = "Name is required";
```

---

## 6. What is form submission?
Form submission refers to sending form data to a server for processing, typically triggered by the submit button. It can be:
- Default HTML form submission (via `action` and `method`)
- JavaScript-controlled submission, with validations and possibly `fetch()` or AJAX to send data

---

## 7. How to improve form accessibility?
- Use semantic elements (`<form>`, `<label>`, `<input>`)
- Ensure all inputs have associated `<label for="id">`
- Use ARIA attributes (`aria-required`, `aria-invalid`) if needed
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Ensure keyboard navigation is possible

---

## 8. How to handle form reset?
Use the `.reset()` method to clear all form fields:

```js
form.reset();
```
You can also manually clear values and error messages for full control.

---

## 9. What are common security issues with forms?
- **XSS (Cross-site scripting):** If user inputs are rendered without sanitization
- **SQL Injection:** When form data is passed directly to database queries
- **CSRF:** Forged submissions to perform unauthorized actions
- **Validation bypass:** Users disabling JavaScript can skip client-side checks

‚û°Ô∏è **Always validate on the server-side as well.**

## 10. How does HTML5 built-in validation differ from JS validation?

| Feature             | HTML5 Built-in                | JavaScript Validation         |
|---------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Simplicity          | Uses `required`, `pattern`, `type` | Requires custom logic         |
| Custom error messages | Limited                      | Fully customizable           |
| Browser support     | Varies                        | Works uniformly across browsers |
| Flexibility         | Limited to attributes         | Full control via JS           |

## ‚ú® Additional Questions You Can Expect

### 11. What is the difference between `input.value` and `input.textContent`?
- `input.value` returns the user input value
- `textContent` is for elements like `<div>` or `<span>`, not form fields

---

### 12. What is regex and how is it used in forms?
Regex (Regular Expression) is a pattern used to match strings. It‚Äôs often used to validate emails, passwords, phone numbers, etc.

Example: `^\d{10}$` ensures a 10-digit number.

---

### 13. Why is form validation important?
- Improves user experience by catching errors early
- Ensures correct and expected data is sent to the server
- Prevents malicious input from causing errors or vulnerabilities

---

### 14. What is the role of `novalidate` attribute in a form?
The `novalidate` attribute disables built-in HTML5 validation, allowing you to handle validation manually via JavaScript.

## üß† Key Concepts You Should Know

### 1. Form Elements
- `<form>`: Wraps all input fields and controls submission.
- `<input>`: Accepts user input (text, email, number, etc.).
- `<textarea>`: Multi-line text input.
- `<button>`: Triggers actions like submit or reset.

### 2. Event Handling
- `submit`: Fired when the form is submitted.
- `input`: Fires on every keystroke in input fields.
- `click`: Fired when an element (like a button) is clicked.

### 3. DOM Manipulation
- Access and modify elements using JavaScript.
- Example:  
    ```js
    document.getElementById("name").value // Gets the value of the input with id="name"
    ```

### 4. Validation
- Ensures input meets rules such as:
    - Required fields
    - Minimum/maximum length
    - Valid formats (email, phone, etc.)

### 5. Regex (Regular Expressions)
- Pattern matching tool used for validation.
- Example:  
    ```js
    /^\w+@\w+\.\w+$/ // Checks email format
    ```

### 6. Form Accessibility
- Use `<label for="id">` to connect labels with inputs.
- Ensure keyboard navigation, proper contrast, and ARIA roles if needed.

### 7. Error Feedback Mechanism
- Show error messages near inputs when validation fails.
- Provide real-time feedback and clearly highlight issues.

### 8. Form Reset & Default Behavior
- `form.reset()` clears all fields.
- `event.preventDefault()` stops default form submission.

### 9. Client-side vs Server-side Logic
- **Client-side:** Fast, improves UX, done in browser (JavaScript).
- **Server-side:** Secure, cannot be bypassed, done after submission.

### 10. HTML5 Validation Attributes
- `required`: Field must be filled.
- `type="email"`: Validates basic email format.
- `pattern`: Custom regex pattern for input.
